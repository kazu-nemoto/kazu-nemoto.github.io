I am a student at Tohoku University since I became a undergrad. I was born in Japan　and I have been here till now. I have been to China, Vietnam, AU, NZ and (digital) Germany (through ZOOM in 2020).

ということで、日本語で描きたいと思っていましたが、残念ながら整備中です、予定は未定、野望は無謀。



My interests
======
I have been doing a research on the field of innovation, management though I have been interested in economics, game theory and market design. And, I WILL make a company at least by my graduation.  Within 2 years. I am wondering not "if my success is still alive", but "if I am way happier than yesterday until my death". Therefore, I am intrested in startups or things like that as well.

私はお寿司が好きです。また経済学のマーケットデザインが興味があります。



My mission
======
is to use economics practically in Japan. In other words, to implement. Many times, I have been asked like; you major in economics, why don’t you be rich with economics? No, no, m8. Ecnomics is just a way of making people and the environment happiner and way more fair,　not an icon of capitalism. That is why I implement economics in order to change what you think economics is and make the world much better.
