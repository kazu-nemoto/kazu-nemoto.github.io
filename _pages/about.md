I am a student at Tohoku University. I was born in Japan. I have been to China, Vietnam, AU, NZ and (digital) Germany (through ZOOM in 2020).

ということで、日本語で描きたいと思っていましたが、残念ながら整備中です、予定は未定、野望は無謀。



My interests
======
I am doing a research on the field of innovation, management although I have been interested in economics, game theory and market design. And, I am preparing for founding mycompany at least by my graduation. I am wondering not "if my success is still alive", but "if I am way happier than yesterday until my death". 

私はお寿司が好きです。また経済学のマーケットデザインが興味があります。



My mission
======
is to use economics practically in Japan. In other words, to implement. Ecnomics is just a way of making people and the environment happiner and way more fair,　not an icon of capitalism. That is why I implement economics in order to change the prejudice against Economics and make the world even much better.

By the way, you might notice something about my name. Yes! All letters are lower cases! Please do not call me a stupid guy. It just shows I do not have  any capital. Please donate. I beg you.
