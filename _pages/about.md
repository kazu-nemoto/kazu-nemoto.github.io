I am a student at Tohoku University. I was born in Japan. I have been to China, Vietnam, AU, NZ and (digital) Germany (through ZOOM in 2020).

ということで、日本語で描きたいと思っていましたが、残念ながら整備中です、予定は未定、野望は無謀。



My interests
======
I did a research on the field of innovation, management though I have been interested in economics, game theory and market design. And, I WILL make a company at least by my graduation.  Within 2 years. I am wondering not "if my success is still alive", but "if I am way happier than yesterday until my death". 

私はお寿司が好きです。また経済学のマーケットデザインが興味があります。



My mission
======
is to use economics practically in Japan. In other words, to implement. Ecnomics is just a way of making people and the environment happiner and way more fair,　not an icon of capitalism. That is why I implement economics in order to change what you think economics is and make the world much better.
