Linkedin pops up, saying "I am thrilled to announce that I got an offer,,, "<br>
In X, I am always looking for a baby's prank though I can always find "I won the final pitch at Techcrunch,,,"<br>

Few years ago, I was around 19 or 20, and I felt I should've won any pitch contest. However, actually, that means nothing in my opinion. <br>

I started my business when I was 23 or so. At first, when you win the prize, i thought it would be worth it. As you can see, it isn’t mostly. Instead, you finish your project with a big tech, and your phone would never sleep for some days.What I meant by here is not that you should not be on the stage and talk with guys from VCs. I respect and appriciate thoese oppotunites but your business would never sprout out. Another muscle is needed. That is sales. Finding your customers.
<br>
<br>
Even though your plan sounds perfect and everyone gives you kudos, those would never guranteee that everythig is great. Just say to you that; "well done." In terms of "business", winning is just "rare", if it is good, is "medium-rare." Literally, it would be a good time for inversters to eat.
<br>
<br>
The world would be greater than you expected and not that evil. However, the system would not be designed for you or work for you. <br>
<br>
Love and appriciate your work and effort but never forget not to win pitches but to do your business.

Increase your prestige by increasing people's prestige is what I have been trying to do currently. Even though you are 20s, you can make a stage for the younger or even, the older. I just recommend making a stage and criteria instead of being getting benefit from those stages and those light cardboard with words, "The first prize.".
<br>
<br>
To do so, you will increase your pristige as people around you are increasing their pristige. That would overcome the core system of the tournament; winner takes all.
<br>
<br>
Gen Z like me, likes making this world better. So, I assume you would prefer doing so hopefully. Try to come out the someone’s dogma. This “someone” implies the past people or the past thinkings. Be the very last person to help this f world.

>Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.  by Steve Jobs in 2005

Thanks, <br>
