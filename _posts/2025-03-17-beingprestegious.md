Linkedin pops up, saying "I am thrilled to announce that I got a offer,,, "<br>
In X, I am always looking for a baby's prank though I always found "I won the final pitch at Techcrunch,,,"<br>

Few years ago, I was around 19 or 20, and I felt I should've have won any pitch contest. However, actually, that means nothing in my opinion. <br>

I started my business when I was 23 or so. At first, when you win the prize, it would be worth it. As you can see, it isn't mostly. Instead, you finish your project with a big tech, and your phone would never sleep for some days.<br>
What I meant by here is not you should be on the stage and talk with guys from VCs. I respect and appriciate thoese oppotunites but your business would never sprout out. Another muscle is needed. That is sales. Finding your customer.<br>

Even though your plan sounds perfect and everyone give you kudos, those would never guranteee that everythig is great. Just say to you that; "well done." In terms of "business", winning is just "rare", if it is good, is "medium-rare." Literally, it would be a good time for VCs to eat.<br>

The world would be greater than you expected and not that evil. However, the system would not be designed for you or work for you. <br>

Love and appriciate your work and effort but never forget not to win pitches but to do your business.<br>



Thanks, <br>
